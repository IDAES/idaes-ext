# Building IDAES Binaries

The build scripts are not intended for general use. IDAES users do not 
generally need to build IDAES binaries. 

Aside from macOS the Linux and Windows builds use Docker, and I'll assume 
we are using Docker Desktop.  The Linux ARM64 builds are done on macOS with 
Docker.  Since Windows Docker containers require Windows, the x86_64 builds
for Linux and Windows are done on Windows.

## Build Environments

### Docker

1. Install Docker Desktop.
2. Get the docker files from https://github.com/IDAES/idaes-ext/tree/main/docker
3. Go to the build-platform directory.
4. From the shell run `docker build -t idaes-ext-{flavor}-build .` in the flavor
  directory. Replace `{flavor}` with the platform (el7, el8, ubuntu1804, ubuntu2004, 
  ubuntu2204, or windows). On ARM64 there is no el7 or windows.
5. Usually testing is done by GitHub actions and the testing inages are built on
  DockerHub, but ARM64 is not supported.  If you need to build testing containers,
  go to the test-platform directory and run `docker build -t idaes-ext-{flavor}-test .`
  in the directory for the platform to build. 

### macOS

1. Install the Xcode command line tools
2. Install cmake (cmake.org), and set it up to run from the command line
3. Install homebrew and a few things:
  * brew install gcc
  * brew install pkgconfig
  * brew install boost
  * brew install bash
  
You only need to rebuild PETSc when you want to update to a new version.  A
recommended location for this is $HOME/src.  For now, we compile without MPI, as
we currently aren't aiming to do super computing.

1. download https://petsc.org/release/download/
2. extract in ~/src
3. Go to PETSC source directory
4. Configure PETSc (-fPIC is so we can use the Metis and Mumps builds again)
   ./configure --with-debug=0 --with-shared=0 --with-mpi=0 --with-fortran-bindings=0 \
      --download-metis --download-mumps --with-mumps-serial=1 \
      --prefix=$HOME/src/petsc-dist 
5. make
6. make install

## Building

### Linux

On Winodws make sure Docker Desktop is set to Linux mode.

1. Go to the build-extensions directory
2. Put coinhsl.zip in the extras directoy if you have it
3. In a bash shell (can use git bash on Windows) run 
  `sh build.sh {flavor}`

### Windows 

The `build.sh` script does not work for the Windows build. There is a PowerShell
script that will work. Make sure Docker Desktop is set to Windows mode (only works
on Windows).

1. Go to the build-extensions directory
2. Put coinhsl.zip in the extras directoy if you have it
3. In powershell run `.\build.ps1 windows --no-cache`

### MacOS

1. Checkout the idaes-ext repo.  
2. In the idaes-ext directory run the script to copy the
  source files to a new build location (
  `sh ./scripts/build_directory.sh ~/src/idaes-ext-build`).
3. Go to the build directory.
4. > bash ./scripts/compile_solvers.sh darwin
5. > bash ./scripts/compile_libs.sh darwin
6. > bash ./scripts/mac_collect.sh

## Testing

### x86 Windows and Linux

We do testing with GitHub actions.  There are container images on docker hub.

### ARM64 Linux

There is a python script `docker_linux_tests.py` in the idaes-ext/scripts directory.

### macOS (Apple Silicon Only)

Test on clean VM.

## Release Hashes

Collect all the tar files for a release in the same directory.

With IDAES installed, run ``idaes hash-release --path <path to tar files> --release <release>``
A text file with the hash of all the files will be written to the directory with the
release files.
