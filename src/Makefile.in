# BOOST is a extra location to look for header files.  Depending on how BOOST is
# obtained the header files may not be in the default search path. This variable
# is optional, and only needs to be set if the boost header files are not found.

# not the boost header files.  This can be set here or with the
# BOOST_HEADER environment variable.
